# Python-inventory-project
Class project working in Python using classes
The original prompt was to create an automobile class for a dealership's inventory system. It needed to have attributes for the make, model, color, year, and mileage and should be able to remove and add vehicles from the inventory.
The program uses a dictionary to track the vehicles, with each vehicle having a unique key created by the make and how many of that specific make have been entered into the class before. This updates dynamically.
